Code-Foo Application
====================

This is the repository for my application to IGN's Code-Foo.

All of my answers appear within the index.html file. My video is also embedded within the page, but I have added it to the folder in case of an issue. All code for the Connect 4 game is held within the connect4 folder. For the best viewing experience please start with the index.html file. It is compatible with all modern browsers, Chrome or Firefox 4+ would be preferred.

I look forward to hearing what you think.
